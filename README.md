## 📚 Specialization Overview

The **AI Agent Developer Specialization** teaches you how to build, evaluate, and deploy intelligent autonomous agents powered by LLMs and modern AI tooling.

**Core areas covered:**
- Prompt Engineering & LLM Fundamentals
- Tool use and Function Calling
- Memory & Long-Term Context
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Planning, Execution, and Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Evaluation & Testing of AI Agents
- Use of frameworks like **LangChain**, **Haystack**, **ReAct**, and **Autogen**

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo** or open any `.ipynb` directly in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions inside each notebook.
3. Most notebooks require an **OpenAI API key** (or similar).
4. Secrets like API keys should be added via Google Colab’s 🔑 “Secrets” tab.

---

## 🔑 API Keys & Environment Setup

To use LLMs and agents effectively, you'll likely need:
- An [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- (Optional) Anthropic, Cohere, or other provider keys
- Basic Python setup in Colab (installations are handled inside notebooks)

---

## 🧠 Frameworks & Libraries Used

- OpenAI API
- LangChain
- HuggingFace Transformers
- FAISS / ChromaDB
- LiteLLM (optional, unified LLM interface)
- Python ≥ 3.8
